Hey, some notes about rspec and capybara here. 

NB that rspec sets up tests for views in /spec/requests, but it really needs to be in /spec/features to allow Capybara to work correctly. 

Also (duh) I had to add 
gem capybara
to the Gemfile. Pleasantly enough, rspec let me know that it wasn't there.
